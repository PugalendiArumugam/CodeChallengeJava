Allows an object to notify multiple observers about changes to its state.

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers)
are notified and updated automatically. It primarily deals with the interaction and communication
between objects, specifically focusing on how objects behave in response to changes in the state of
other objects.
